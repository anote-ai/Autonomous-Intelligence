# Key Components

Panacea comprises several integral components that work together to provide a robust and efficient automation framework:

- **Interface**: The user-facing component where natural language queries are inputted. It serves as the bridge between human instructions and the orchestrator.
- **Orchestrator**: The central unit that interprets user queries, divides tasks, and assigns them to the appropriate agents.
- **Nodes (Agents)**: Autonomous AI agents, each specialized in handling specific tasks.
- **Edges**: Communication channels that facilitate interaction and data exchange between agents.
- **Environment**: The workspace for each agent, equipped with the necessary resources and requirements to perform its designated tasks.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Systems that track agent activities, providing transparency and insights into workflow processes.
