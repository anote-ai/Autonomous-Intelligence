# Multi-Agent AI Systems: Winter Open Source Project

This is an open-sourced, research-driven initiative designed to explore and develop multi-agent AI systems over the winter. The project focuses on building a **General Purpose AI Agent Framework** and establishing a **Registry of Domain-Specific AI Agents**.

## Agenda: 
- Intros
- AI Agent Project Overview
- Agent Presentation
- Agent Registry
- Agent Product Specs
- Codebase Setup
- Communications / Next Steps
- Q&A

## Product Overview
- **Framework**: [General Purpose AI Agent Framework](https://privatechatbot.ai/)
- **Registry**: A collection of specialized AI agents tailored to specific domains.

## Project Milestones
### 1. Documentation
- Comprehensive guides for understanding and using the framework and registry.

### 2. Website / Landing Page
- A user-friendly interface for showcasing the project.

### 3. Product Development
- **Frontend/UI**: Intuitive design for interaction.
- **Backend**: Scalable and efficient architecture.
- **Software Developer Kit (SDK)**: Tools for developers to build and integrate agents.

### 4. Framework for Agent Registry
- A structured catalog of reusable, domain-specific AI agents.

### 5. Final Deliverables (Early February)
- Contribute to the **open-source agent** repository or develop a **closed-source agent** to add to the registry.
- Deliver a **Final Presentation** during “AI Day,” showcasing:
  - Video tutorials of AI agents in action.
  - Research insights from the project.

## Using Agentic Systems
The project enables various ways to deploy and use AI agent systems:

### 1. Run on the Web
- Access through the **product UI**.

### 2. Run On-Premise
- Deploy via a **desktop application**.

### 3. Call via API
- Use the **developer kit** to integrate into applications.

### 4. Query Processing with Orchestrator
- NLP queries are routed to one or more agents (Agent 1, Agent 2, Agent 3, etc.).
- Tasks are performed either **in series** or **in parallel**.
- The system generates and returns an **output** to the user.
- Includes **logs** to monitor agent progress.

### 5. Agent Templates and Compound Systems
- Spawn agent templates directly into the chatbot.
- Use a **Drag & Drop Flow** to design and execute compound agent systems.

## Get Involved
Join the initiative by contributing to the open-source repository, building specialized agents, or collaborating on research and development. Showcase your work during the **AI Day** event!

Note: to run code correctly you'll need to replace the openAI api key
