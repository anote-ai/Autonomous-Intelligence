# Autonomous Intelligence

Autonomous Intelligence is an open-sourced, research-driven initiative aimed at revolutionizing collaborative multi-agent AI systems. By combining modular design principles and cutting-edge machine learning techniques, this project empowers developers and organizations to build, deploy, and optimize AI agents that work seamlessly in dynamic, complex environments.

## Product Overview

### General Purpose Multi-Agent Framework
The framework provides a robust infrastructure for creating and managing multiple AI agents. It enables seamless collaboration between agents to tackle complex tasks, dynamically adapting to user inputs and changing conditions.

### Domain-Specific Agent Registry
The registry offers a catalog of prebuilt agents optimized for specific domains, such as coding, data analysis, and natural language processing. This allows users to quickly integrate tailored solutions into their workflows without extensive setup.

### Smart Orchestration
Task execution is automated through dynamic selection of the best agents, tools, and workflows for the job. The system handles dependencies, monitors progress, and troubleshoots issues in real time.

### User Interaction
Users can design and visualize workflows using an intuitive drag-and-drop interface or directly interact with agents through conversational natural language queries.

### SDK and API Access
Developers can leverage tools for integrating AI agent functionality into their applications. The platform supports customization and modular development for scalability and efficiency.

## How It Works

### Core Components

| Component           | Description                                                                                   |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Orchestrator**    | Central hub for task assignment, execution, and monitoring. Manages agent interactions and refines workflows dynamically. |
| **Agents**          | Autonomous modules designed for specific tasks or subtasks. Examples include:                 |
|                     | - **Coding Agent**: Debugs and generates code.                                                |
|                     | - **RAG/Q&A Agent**: Retrieves and summarizes answers from unstructured data.                 |
|                     | - **NER Agent**: Extracts entities and classifies text.                                       |
|                     | - **Web-Surfing Agent**: Gathers data from the internet.                                      |
| **Agent Registry**  | A structured catalog that organizes agents by domain, task type, and functionality. Users can select and deploy agents directly. |
| **Frontend Interface** | Drag-and-drop visual workflow builder and real-time dashboards for monitoring, debugging, and optimizing agent performance. |
| **Backend Infrastructure** | Scalable architecture with robust APIs for inter-agent communication, task logging, and workflow tracking. Supports private deployment. |

## Workflow Example

1. **Input Query**: The user provides a task, e.g., “Summarize this document and email the key points.”
2. **Agent Selection**: The orchestrator selects the relevant agents (e.g., NER Agent, Email Agent).
3. **Task Execution**: Agents collaborate to process the document, extract key points, and draft the email.
4. **Result Delivery**: The system returns the output (draft email) to the user.
5. **Feedback Loop**: User feedback is incorporated to refine the results or improve the workflow.
