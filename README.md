# Autonomous Intelligence

Autonomous Intelligence is an open-sourced, research-driven initiative aimed at building collaborative multi-agent AI systems. By combining modular design principles and cutting-edge machine learning techniques, this project empowers developers and organizations to build, deploy, and optimize AI agents that work well in dynamic, complex environments.

## Product Overview

### General Purpose Multi-Agent Framework
The framework provides a robust infrastructure for creating and managing multiple AI agents. It enables seamless collaboration between agents to tackle complex tasks, dynamically adapting to user inputs and changing conditions.

### Domain-Specific Agent Registry
The registry offers a catalog of prebuilt agents optimized for specific domains, such as coding, data analysis, and natural language processing. This allows users to quickly integrate tailored solutions into their workflows without extensive setup.

### Smart Orchestration
Task execution is automated through dynamic selection of the best agents, tools, and workflows for the job. The system handles dependencies, monitors progress, and troubleshoots issues in real time.

### Core Components

| Component                    | Description                                                                                       |
|------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Orchestrator**             | Central hub for task assignment, execution, and monitoring. Manages agent interactions and refines workflows dynamically. |
| **Agent**                    | An autonomous unit programmed to perform tasks, make decisions, and communicate with other agents. |
| **Task**                     | A specific assignment completed by an agent, providing all necessary details like description, tools, and responsibilities. |
| **Crew**                     | A collaborative group of agents working together to achieve a set of tasks. Crews define strategies for task execution and agent collaboration. |
| **Process Implementations**  | Frameworks for agent collaboration. This includes sequential tasks that are executed in an orderly progression, or hierarchical tasks are managed via a structured chain of command|
| **Large Language Models (LLMs)** | Backbone of intelligent agents, enabling capabilities like natural language understanding and reasoning. Includes models like GPT, Claude, Mistral, Gemini, and Llama that are Optimized for complex workflows. |
| **Tool**                     | A skill or function agents use to perform actions, that includes capabilities like search, computer use, data extraction, file uploading and advanced interactions. |
| **Agent Registry**           | A structured catalog organizing agents by domain, task type, and functionality, allowing users to deploy agents seamlessly. |
| **Frontend Interface**       | Drag-and-drop visual workflow builder and real-time dashboards for monitoring, debugging, and optimizing agent performance. |

## Workflow Example

![alt text](https://github.com/nv78/Autonomous-Intelligence/blob/main/materials/assets/Example.png?raw=true)

1. **Input Query**: The user provides a task, e.g., “Summarize this document and email the key points.”
2. **Agent Selection**: The orchestrator selects the relevant agents (e.g., NER Agent, Email Agent).
3. **Task Execution**: Agents collaborate to process the document, extract key points, and draft the email.
4. **Result Delivery**: The system returns the output (draft email) to the user.
5. **Feedback Loop**: User feedback is incorporated to refine the results or improve the workflow.
